25th June, 2016.

This was the first piece I ever made and these are the only photos that were taken. It ended up being a procession around the Bristol harbourside. I had nothing to do with art at the time - I made this piece on a whim when I was thinking about the impact of the mainstream press on Brexit and what it would mean going forward. I didn't think about this as starting my practice at all. It was about two years later that I started to make work but looking back this was the first public thing to happen.
Two friends, Tom and Rajiv, accompanied me whilst singing on repeat: 

"Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, and I say

It's all right

It's all right"
