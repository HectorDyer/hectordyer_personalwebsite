2022, Kings Crescent Estate, Hackney

'Our Place in the Game' was a site-specific project created on the Kings Crescent Estate in Hackney. Over a series of workshops, I worked with a group of residents and Nikolett Puskas (researcher) to respond to the question - what is our place in the game? 

Our principles of working were built around co-creation, listening and responding. How can we remain as open as possible to what will emerge whilst holding enough of a framework so that everyone feels supported? 

We talked about the role of individuals and communities against the climate emergency, the presence of nature on an urban estate, what it means to come together for a common cause and the many, many stories we all hold. 

From these conversations, we created a series of performances around the estate. We thought of them as different ‘stations’ that people could discover on a live journey.
