2022, Kings Crescent Estate, Hackney

'Our Place in the Game' was a site-specific project created on the Kings Crescent Estate in Hackney. Over a series of workshops, I worked with a group of residents and Nikolett Puskas (researcher) to respond to the question - what is our place in the game? 

Our principles of working were built around co-creation, listening and responding. How can we remain as open as possible to what will emerge whilst holding enough of a framework so that everyone feels supported? 

We talked about the role of individuals and communities against the climate emergency, the presence of nature on an urban estate, what it means to come together for a common cause and the many, many stories we all hold. 

From these conversations, we created a series of performances around the estate. We thought of them as different ‘stations’ that people could discover on a live journey.

Studio MaBa (Baiba Sprance & Marco Berardi) created a 7 minute film of the performance which can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KN9OcJHZmIU4V7OU_JZ6UCzyM0ojo0Wj/view). This was exhibited at the Grant Museum, UCL, along with the costumes made by Chell Young.

Anahí Saravia Herrera created a zine with the participants all about the process and ideas that emerged. She hand-printed 50 copies of them - there are copies in the British Library, Hackney Showroom's Library as well as the N4 Library in Finsbury Park. 
To help access to this publication, Anahi also created digital versions of the zine in English and in Turkish. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ysueyco2ZwxuapxSoWXsDcHNZWCRtG4q/view) is a link the English version.

The photographs on this page are by Jemima Yong. There were so many that could have been chosen - a fair few more are in the Zine.
