I worked as Assistant Curator for the first ever exhibition of Michael Clark, at the Barbican Art Gallery. It showcased his unique multi-disciplinary approach that brought together a wide range of subcultural influences. Film, photography and material from Clarkâ€™s practice was presented alongside his collaborations, with work from Charles Atlas, Leigh Bowery, Sarah Lucas, Wolfgang Tillmans, Cerith Wyn Evans and others.
